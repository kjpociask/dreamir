To explain something about my past, we flash back to a 
time in my life when I was living in a large kingdom. Suddenly
the story plays out like we are in a video game and the music 
and look of everything is slightly pixelated. The storyline is that
we are taking transport to the castle. The man to my right is my
beau, but he is inattentive and we do not end up together in the present.
We are receiving some sort of hero's welcome from the cricket song. I am 
the hero, but I don't know what I did.
